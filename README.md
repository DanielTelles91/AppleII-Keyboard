# Apple II Keyboard Adapter

This is a simple Arduino project to allow connecting a PS/2 keyboard to the
16 pin DIP keyboard connector on an Apple II. I've tested it on a
ReactiveMicro reproduction Apple II+ RFI logic board and it works great.

All keys are mapped to modern keyboard equivalents and the Apple can be
reset with the Ctrl-PrtScrn key combo.
